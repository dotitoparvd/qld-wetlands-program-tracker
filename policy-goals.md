# Queensland Wetlands Program – Core Goals

The Queensland Wetlands Program (QWP) is a strategic framework that guides wetland protection, management, and restoration across the state. Below are its main objectives and key strategies.

## 1. Protect and Conserve High‑Value Wetlands

**Objective:** Ensure the long‑term ecological integrity of Queensland’s most significant wetlands, including Ramsar sites, nationally important wetlands, and regionally critical habitats.

**Key Actions:**
- Identify and formally map wetlands of high conservation value.
- Establish and enforce protective zoning in planning schemes.
- Strengthen legal safeguards under the *Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act 1999* (EPBC Act) and Queensland’s *Nature Conservation Act 1992*.

## 2. Improve Wetland Management Through Science and Monitoring

**Objective:** Base management decisions on robust scientific data and ongoing monitoring to track wetland health and respond to emerging threats.

**Key Actions:**
- Develop and maintain a state‑wide wetland inventory and mapping system.
- Implement standardised water‑quality and ecological‑health monitoring programs.
- Support research on wetland hydrology, nutrient cycling, and climate‑change resilience.

## 3. Engage Communities and Landholders in Stewardship

**Objective:** Foster partnerships with Traditional Owners, local communities, landholders, and industry to promote on‑ground stewardship and shared responsibility for wetland health.

**Key Actions:**
- Deliver community‑based restoration and rehabilitation grants.
- Provide technical guidance and resources for private‑land wetland management.
- Raise public awareness through education campaigns and citizen‑science initiatives.

## Funding and Resources

Sustained funding and adequate resources are critical to achieving the long‑term goals of the Queensland Wetlands Program. Many of the key actions—such as mapping, monitoring, community grants, and research—require consistent financial support from both state and federal governments, as well as partnerships with private and philanthropic sectors. Without reliable funding, the program risks becoming a collection of good intentions rather than a driver of on‑ground change. Tracking funding commitments and resource allocations will help ensure that the program’s ambitious objectives are matched by the necessary means to implement them.
